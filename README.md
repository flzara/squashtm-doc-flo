### MkDocs Installation

> If you know Python well enough, you may setup a virtual environnement before to keep your installation clean. `gitignore` contains an exclusion for a `.venv/` directory for this purpose.

MkDocs is a Python software. Once the latter is installed, the former is just a couple command away:

```sh
pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Check that it works

```sh
$ mkdocs --version
mkdocs, version 1.1.2
```

### Useful commands

- `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
- `mkdocs build` - Build locally the documentation website. By default it is build under the `site/` directory. That's why it is declared in Â `.gitignore`.
- `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

### Good practices

- Please configure your editor to
    - Use `CRLF` as End Of Line
    - Use spaces for tabs
    - Use a tab size of 4
